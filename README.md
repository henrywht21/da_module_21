Utilization of Neural Networks

This project utilizes deep learning to solve a classification problem through iterations on a neural network model. A file of 30000 rows related to funding of venutres through the nonprofit Alphabet Soup was used to train and test this model. This explores the impact of different layers, activations, counts of neurons, and data engineering, with the ultimate goal of attaining an accuracy of over 75%. 

Within the upload, there is a notebook which includes 4 interations of the model (the final of which is the third iteration with improved feature engineering) and a .h5 file for the saved-off model. At the end of the notebook is the report with the analysis of the project.
